# Match-Making
This is a match making algorithm I wrote in java for Riot Games League of Legends however it can be extended to any game that has 5 positions per team and uses MMR(match making rank) system to match players. 

My goals for this project were as follows:
	1.	Learn about Max Priority Queues and create a custom Priority Queue data structure.
	2.	Improve on OOD.
	3.	Create an algorithm that can sort a player base of any size into teams of equal skill.
